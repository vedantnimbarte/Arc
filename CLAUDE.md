# CLAUDE.md — Orientation for Claude Code

You are working in **ARC**, an AI-native terminal & agent runtime. This file is your starting point. Read it first, then [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for the deeper map.

## What ARC is

A Tauri (Rust) + React (TS) desktop app that aims to combine:

- A real PTY-backed terminal (xterm.js front, `portable-pty` back)
- An embedded code editor (CodeMirror 6)
- Multi-agent orchestration with background execution
- Local + cloud AI providers behind one interface

Phase 1 (current) ships an end-to-end **PTY terminal, file tree, CodeMirror editor, and streaming AI chat** (OpenAI / Anthropic / Ollama). Agent runtime, persistence, indexing, git introspection, and MCP are still scaffolded stubs.

## Repo layout

```
apps/
  desktop/     Tauri shell. Rust crate that registers `pty_*`, `llm_*`, and
               `fs_*` commands and serves apps/frontend's build (or dev server)
               inside a window. Depends on the /rust/* crates.
  frontend/    React + Vite + TS app. Pure UI. Talks to Rust via Tauri
               `invoke` and `listen` (see src/lib/tauri.ts).

packages/      Pure-TS packages, linked via pnpm workspaces.
  shared/        Cross-package types.
  provider-sdk/  Provider interface (Provider, ChatRequest, ChatChunk).
  ai-runtime/    TS stub provider — legacy. Real streaming providers now live
                 in `rust/ai-runtime`; this package is kept only for the
                 `Provider` shape and may be removed.
  terminal/      Reserved — placeholder until we extract terminal logic out of
                 apps/frontend.
  editor/        Reserved — same idea for the editor.
  agents/        Agent descriptors (TS side). Pairs with rust/agent-runtime.
  mcp/           Reserved — MCP client.
  ui/            Reserved — shared UI primitives.

rust/          Cargo workspace members consumed by apps/desktop.
  pty/             ✅ PtyManager — spawn/write/resize/kill, streams output via
                   tokio::sync::mpsc.
  ai-runtime/      ✅ Streaming chat providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama)
                   behind one `Provider` trait. Driven by `llm_*` commands.
  session-manager/ stub — workspace + tab persistence.
  agent-runtime/   stub — agent execution.
  filesystem/      stub — indexing + watch. (Lightweight `fs_*` commands
                   currently live in apps/desktop/src/commands/fs.rs as a
                   stopgap until this crate exists.)
  git/             stub — diff/blame/log.

docs/          Architecture + decisions.
```

## Running it

```bash
pnpm install           # installs JS deps for all workspaces
pnpm tauri:dev         # boots Tauri → spawns vite → opens the window
```

Frontend-only (no Rust, no PTY):

```bash
pnpm dev               # opens http://127.0.0.1:5173 — UI only, anything that
                       # needs `invoke`/`listen` (PTY, fs, LLM) is gated off
                       # and chat falls back to a local echo stub
```

Type-check / sanity:

```bash
pnpm typecheck
cargo check --workspace
```

## Key conventions

- **Tauri command names**: `<area>_<verb>` snake_case. Today: `pty_*` (spawn/write/resize/kill), `llm_*` (stream/cancel), `fs_*` (default_root, parent, read_dir, pick_folder, read_file, write_file).
- **Event topics**: `<area>://<verb>/<id>`, e.g. `pty://data/<uuid>`, `llm://chunk/<id>`, `llm://done/<id>`. The frontend's `lib/tauri.ts` exposes typed wrappers — use those, don't hand-roll `invoke`/`listen` in components.
- **State**: Zustand stores in `apps/frontend/src/state/*` — one per concern (`workspace`, `chat`, `settings`, `files`). Components don't reach across stores. `settings` and `files` persist to localStorage via `zustand/middleware`.
- **Styling**: Tailwind, dark-first. Theme tokens are in `apps/frontend/tailwind.config.ts` (`bg-base`, `fg-base`, `accent`, etc.). Don't hardcode hex colors in components.
- **Rust modules**: One feature per crate (`arc-pty`, `arc-agent-runtime`, ...). The desktop app *composes* them; it shouldn't grow business logic of its own.
- **Errors crossing the IPC boundary**: Map to `String` at the command layer. Internal Rust code uses `anyhow::Result`.

## What's stubbed vs. real

| Area              | Status         | Notes                                                                  |
| ----------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| PTY → xterm.js    | ✅ real         | Default shell (COMSPEC on Win, SHELL elsewhere), resize, kill on close |
| Tabs / workspace  | ✅ real         | In-memory only; persistence is Phase 2                                 |
| AI chat           | ✅ real         | OpenAI / Anthropic / Ollama streaming via `rust/ai-runtime`. API keys in Settings (⌘,). |
| Editor            | ✅ real         | CodeMirror 6, lazy-loaded per tab. Reads/writes via `fs_read_file` / `fs_write_file`; 5 MiB cap, refuses binaries. |
| File tree         | ✅ real         | Browse + open files, pick root via native dialog, click-to-paste paths into the active terminal. |
| Filesystem index  | ⛔ stub        | `rust/filesystem` is a placeholder. Lightweight `fs_*` commands live in `apps/desktop/src/commands/fs.rs` until that crate exists. |
| Session persist   | ⛔ stub        | `rust/session-manager` types only; no SQLite yet                        |
| Agent runtime     | ⛔ stub        | Types only                                                              |
| Git introspection | ⛔ stub        | `rust/git` placeholder                                                  |
| Memory / search   | ⛔ stub        | SQLite + embeddings not started                                         |
| MCP, plugins      | ⛔ stub        | Placeholder packages                                                    |
| Bundling / icons  | 🟡 placeholder | Icons are auto-generated placeholders. Replace before shipping.         |

## Working in this repo

- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones. New crates/packages should appear in `Cargo.toml` workspace members and `pnpm-workspace.yaml` first.
- When adding a new Tauri command, update both `apps/desktop/src/commands/<area>.rs` AND `apps/frontend/src/lib/tauri.ts` so the typed wrapper stays in sync.
- Run `pnpm typecheck && cargo check --workspace` before finishing a change.
- The default shell on Windows is `cmd.exe` via `COMSPEC`. If you want PowerShell, pass `shell: "powershell.exe"` to `pty_spawn`.
